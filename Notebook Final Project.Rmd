This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk (=result printed under the code) by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I* (*Cmd + Alt + I on Max*).

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

fct <- rep(0,100)
for (i in 1:100){
    fct[i] <- i
}
```{r}
plot (fct**2)
```


```{r}
fct <- rep(0,100)
for (i in 1:100){
    fct[i] <- i
}
plot (fct**2,type="l")
```
